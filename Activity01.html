             <h1>Wonka</h1>
             <ul>Wonderfully pays homage to the musical, book and film, carefully incorporating elements of all while 
              adding unique moments of its own. The Oompa Loompa was a great example of this,
               being not overplayed and a chorus of them justifiably not needed, but a single 
               Oompa Loompa references the original text, is adapted to the new version creatively with a completely
                new sense of whimsey and humour that gives an adaptation a sense of originality.
